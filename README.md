# ‚≠ê StarTrack

**StarTrack** is an interactive web-based dashboard and machine learning pipeline for stellar classification using spectral data. It allows users to query stars by **PLATE-MJD-FIBERID** and view both **model predictions** and **actual classifications**, enabling a comparative, hands-on exploration of stellar data. Designed as a learning experience and showcase project, StarTrack combines tabular and spectral analysis through a **multimodal deep learning system**.

## üöÄ Features

- üî≠ **Star Lookup** by PLATE, MJD, and FIBERID  
- üß† Dual-model predictions:
  - **Dense Model** for tabular metadata (e.g., redshift, magnitudes)
  - **BiLSTM Model** for raw spectral sequence data
- üåå **Fusion architecture** combining both representations
- üìä Comparison of model outputs vs. actual SDSS subclass labels
- üåê Fully responsive web dashboard built with **React.js**

## üß† ML Architecture

StarTrack‚Äôs pipeline includes:

- **Tabular Branch**: A dense neural network trained on features like redshift, magnitude, and signal-to-noise ratio.  
- **Spectral Branch**: A Bidirectional LSTM trained on normalized 1D spectral flux values.  
- **Fusion Module**: Outputs from both branches are concatenated and passed through a multi-head attention mechanism to produce the final subclass prediction.

> ‚úÖ Models trained and evaluated using data from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)](https://www.sdss.org/)
